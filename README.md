Tools to improve and make BC developers easy

Current available functions:

- Select & change company

## Select & Change Company

One of most annoying things when working with Business Central is when you need to change the company you're currently working. Too many clicks. It has no sense that we must go to My Settings from the menu and change company every time. When working with multiple companies it's a big waste of time.

My solution it's kind of easy. Just select the company you want to open a new tab will open.

In fact, there's a suggestion on Dynamics 365 Ideas website asking Microsoft to improve this.

## View / Delete table records

I also miss the chance to access all table data (like used to do from Developer client). There's an easy way to get access to any table just by typing the URL. For developers sometimes it's easiest to remember tables nos. but some consultant colleagues always remember the name. So, I created a list where we can look for and select the desired table and show all records on a new tab.

There's also an option to delete all records from selected table. Just be careful. No way back!!

## Kill Sessions

Sometimes we need to kill some sessions. Just an infinite loop or something killing your system. Just select the desired session and kill it.

Current session is the one in bold and we're not able to kill.

## Company Information Badge Update

When managing different companies it's also annoying to setup one by badges in order to differentiate them. So, why not better having one place to rule them all?
